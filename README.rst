Python FritzBox Client
======================

Based on the `TR-064 standard`_.

This is **far** from being finished. The project is currently in a very
experimental phase. Nothing *really* works yet except SSDP discovery and SOAP
marshalling.

I still need to decide on how the user-interface and internal API for TR-064
will look like. Either more dynamic or more static? I am currently toying
around with different ideas and it's always possible some ideas get tossed out
the window. As long as there's no ``master`` branch: Don't trust this
repository yet! ;)
